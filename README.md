**TASK 3**: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

During this experience, I had the opportunity to analyze and interpret data about the bar chart and histogram, it is a graphical representation of the distribution of data points in a dataset.

🔍 I applied my skills with the help of VSCode notebook to uncover insights, enhance decision-making processes, and analyze the pattern of the dataset. 📈

🔍 Actively engaged in continuous learning, staying abreast of the latest trends in data science and technology. 🚀 Excited about the opportunity to apply my expanding skill set to future projects and challenges.
